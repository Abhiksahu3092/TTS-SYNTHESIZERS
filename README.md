## Tasks Completed
1. Data mining - \
    (i). Scraping hindi newspaper( Bhaskar) for 3 major category i.e Sports, technology and opinion articles.\
    (ii). Saved the raw data in subdirectory "raw" inside the parent directory "data"\
2. Data cleaning -\
    (i). Split sentences using à¥¤ (poorna-viram) as a delimiter.\
    (ii). Preserved all other punctuation (commas, exclamations, etc.)\
    (iii). Applied regex filters to:\
        (a). Replace web URLs with the word "website"\
        (b). Remove sentences with phone numbers or junk (e.g., street addresses)\
        (c). Saved the cleaned data in subdirectory "cleaned" and junk data in subidirectory "junk" inside the parent directory "data"\
3. Transliteration (Roman â†’ Devanagari) - \
    (i). Used OpenRouter API with a free LLaMA model\
    (ii). Transliterated roman sentences into Devanagari script\
4. Code-Mixing Estimation -\
    (i). After transliteration, we calculated the percentage of Roman-script (code-mixed) words in each sentence before conversion.\
    (ii). Various analytics such as percentage of code-mixing, no. of unique words and code-mixed words will be available in terminal while running the script\
